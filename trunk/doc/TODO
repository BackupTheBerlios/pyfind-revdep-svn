Some ideas for future development:

* Verify and catch all related exceptions, to avoid
abnormal terminations.
(done) * Try a prediction of what packages are behind
broken files, based on /var/log/packages list
of installed packages.
* provide a list of python packages who have to
be reinstalled to match a new python package
installation.
* provide a list of perl packages who have to
be reinstalled to match a new perl package
installation.
* extend compatibility to python 3.x.
* create unit tests to verify functions behaviour's
correctness (lower priority).
* Improve the package prediction, fix known problems


-------------------------------------------------

Known problems:
* Prediction of broken package do not concern packages
who are not installed yet ("unknown" ones), as I don't have
a reliable method to have a list of files for each
package to be built from source (e.g. from SBo slackbuilds).
