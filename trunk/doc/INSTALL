pyfind_revdep requires at least Python 2.5.x. It doesn't
support Python 3.x yet.

It depends only on python standard library modules.

To install this distribution, simply run the following
with root's privileges:
        python ./setup.py build
        python ./setup.py install

This program is meant to be used in Slackware GNU/Linux 
distribution (mainly in latest "stable" version, but it
should work on previous version, too).
